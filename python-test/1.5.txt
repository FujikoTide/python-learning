Calculating the factorial of a number:
I feel like this is a reasonably simple mathematical calcualtion and therefore a function would be all that is needed.



Building a simple bank application (accounts, transactions):
This is an OOP project.
Classes can include: 
  Customer: includes account_ID, name, address, methods for changing some of those
  Account: Includes properties like customer_ID, account_balance, interest_rate etc, methods for changing some of those
  Transaction: methods such as add_money, remove_money, add_interest and so on



Sorting a list of integers:
again a function would suffice



Representing playing cards and a deck of cards:
this would be some classes: Card, Cards
Card would have properties: suit, value
Cards would have properties: List[Card]
Cards would have methods: shuffle, deal, remove_card (this could be removing a card from a random position in the deck, not necessarily dealing a card from the top), add_card, reset_deck



Converting temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit:
again a simple mathematical function, but if it was converting from C to F and also from F to C, then perhaps a simple class may suffice
